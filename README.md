# Solar-Panel-Optimization
In this project, we focused on optimizing the efficiency of solar panels. By employing various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and LSTM, we aimed to predict the optimal tilt angle for solar panels. This optimal angle helps in maximizing the energy efficiency of the panels.
